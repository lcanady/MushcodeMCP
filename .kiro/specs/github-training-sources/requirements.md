# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the MUSHCODE MCP server's knowledge base by adding two additional GitHub repositories as training sources: thenomain/GMCCG and thenomain/Mu--Support-Systems. These repositories contain valuable MUSHCODE examples, patterns, and implementations that will improve the server's ability to generate, validate, and optimize MUSHCODE for various MUD environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a MUSHCODE developer, I want the MCP server to have access to additional high-quality MUSHCODE repositories so that it can provide better code generation and examples based on proven implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system scrapes GitHub repositories THEN it SHALL include thenomain/GMCCG repository in the scraping process
2. WHEN the system scrapes GitHub repositories THEN it SHALL include thenomain/Mu--Support-Systems repository in the scraping process
3. WHEN scraping these repositories THEN the system SHALL extract MUSHCODE files and patterns for knowledge base integration
4. WHEN scraping completes THEN the system SHALL store the extracted knowledge in the appropriate knowledge base structures

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the GitHub scraping configuration to be easily maintainable so that I can add or remove repositories without modifying core code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring repository sources THEN the system SHALL use a configuration-driven approach for repository URLs
2. WHEN adding new repositories THEN the system SHALL NOT require changes to core scraping logic
3. WHEN the scraping process runs THEN it SHALL handle repository access errors gracefully
4. IF a repository is inaccessible THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with other repositories

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a MUSHCODE developer, I want the knowledge base to be updated with content from the new repositories so that I can access examples and patterns from these sources through MCP tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the knowledge base is populated THEN it SHALL include patterns and examples from thenomain/GMCCG
2. WHEN the knowledge base is populated THEN it SHALL include patterns and examples from thenomain/Mu--Support-Systems
3. WHEN using MCP tools THEN the system SHALL be able to reference knowledge from these new sources
4. WHEN generating code THEN the system SHALL incorporate patterns learned from these repositories

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want the scraping process to be efficient and not duplicate existing functionality so that the system remains performant and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scraping repositories THEN the system SHALL reuse existing GitHub scraping infrastructure
2. WHEN processing repository content THEN the system SHALL avoid duplicating existing knowledge base entries
3. WHEN the scraping process runs THEN it SHALL complete within reasonable time limits
4. WHEN storing scraped content THEN the system SHALL maintain existing knowledge base structure and formats
