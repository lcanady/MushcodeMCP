# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that specializes in generating high-quality MUSHCODE for Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) development. The server will provide tools and resources to help developers write, validate, and optimize MUSHCODE efficiently, leveraging AI assistance to understand MUSHCODE syntax, patterns, and best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a MUD developer, I want an MCP server that can generate MUSHCODE functions and commands, so that I can quickly implement game mechanics without having to write boilerplate code from scratch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a MUSHCODE function THEN the server SHALL generate syntactically correct MUSHCODE that follows established conventions
2. WHEN a user specifies function parameters and behavior THEN the server SHALL create appropriate MUSHCODE with proper attribute handling and security considerations
3. WHEN generating code THEN the server SHALL include appropriate comments explaining the code's purpose and usage
4. WHEN creating functions THEN the server SHALL follow MUSHCODE naming conventions and best practices

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a MUD administrator, I want the MCP server to validate existing MUSHCODE, so that I can identify syntax errors and potential security issues before deploying code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits MUSHCODE for validation THEN the server SHALL check for syntax errors and return detailed feedback
2. WHEN validating code THEN the server SHALL identify potential security vulnerabilities such as improper permission checks
3. WHEN code contains errors THEN the server SHALL provide specific line numbers and suggested fixes
4. WHEN validation is successful THEN the server SHALL confirm the code follows MUSHCODE best practices

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a MUSHCODE developer, I want the server to provide code optimization suggestions, so that I can improve performance and maintainability of my existing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests code optimization THEN the server SHALL analyze the provided MUSHCODE and suggest improvements
2. WHEN optimizing code THEN the server SHALL identify inefficient patterns and recommend better alternatives
3. WHEN suggesting optimizations THEN the server SHALL maintain the original functionality while improving performance
4. WHEN providing suggestions THEN the server SHALL explain the reasoning behind each optimization

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a new MUSHCODE developer, I want the server to provide educational resources and examples, so that I can learn MUSHCODE syntax and patterns effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests help with MUSHCODE concepts THEN the server SHALL provide clear explanations with practical examples
2. WHEN explaining syntax THEN the server SHALL include both basic and advanced usage patterns
3. WHEN providing examples THEN the server SHALL demonstrate real-world use cases relevant to MUD development
4. WHEN teaching concepts THEN the server SHALL progress from simple to complex examples logically

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a MUD developer, I want the MCP server to integrate seamlessly with my development environment, so that I can access MUSHCODE assistance without leaving my IDE.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server is configured THEN it SHALL be discoverable through standard MCP protocols
2. WHEN tools are invoked THEN the server SHALL respond within reasonable time limits (under 5 seconds for most operations)
3. WHEN integrated with IDEs THEN the server SHALL provide consistent functionality across different MCP-compatible environments
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the server SHALL provide meaningful error messages that help users resolve issues

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a MUSHCODE developer, I want the server to understand different MUSHCODE dialects and server types, so that I can get appropriate code for my specific MUD server implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user specifies a MUD server type THEN the server SHALL generate code appropriate for that server's MUSHCODE dialect
2. WHEN working with different dialects THEN the server SHALL understand syntax variations and feature differences
3. WHEN generating code THEN the server SHALL default to widely compatible MUSHCODE patterns when server type is not specified
4. WHEN dialect-specific features are used THEN the server SHALL clearly indicate compatibility requirements
